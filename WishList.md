#All of the glorious feature creep that we would do if we had time.

# The Wish List #

Add all the features that you want but we don't have time to implement here.


# List: #

  1. PMO -> Company Remedial Attendance
  1. Intramurals (for the PMO and in general)
  1. Individual MID submitting temp attendance for upcoming musters (i.e. I'm not going to be at any Noon meal formations. or I'm going to miss evening meal formation every Friday from now until X date.)
  1. Ajax that handles all the form validations and dynamic page refreshes for every applicable page, such as notification that you successfully changed your password.  This feature is basically exactly like what google uses for this page whenever you change something.
