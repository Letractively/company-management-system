# General Overview #
The CMS is a self-contained product, but it complements the existing MIDS system. CMS will not interface with MIDS at all but rather work alongside to aid and supplement functionality. This is because Ward Hall will not allow third party software to interface with MIDS. All the capabilities and functionalities of CMS will be controlled by granular user levels to account for all the different company billets.
